- make it so that if a piece cant be move (like trying to move the rook on the first move), it says the move is invalid

- clean user input so the user can put a2,a4 as valid input

- can't move to the same position

- getting a pawn to the end allows you to switch it out for a queen or another piece

- castling except when king is in check or when castling would put the king in check

- en passant but make sure it occurs immediately after a player has moved two moves up

- king can't put himself in check

- pieces can block a check

- may be problem where both kings are in check
